								<ul>
									<li><strong>How do I join?</strong> <p>Through our Whatsapp <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/EOglHDPgfWJ3RONWVcgjG8">here</a>!</p></li>
									<li><strong>When and where do we meet?</strong> <p>We meet in N672 (Main Building) Mondays 1:30-3:00 and Wednesdays 2:00-5:00</p></li>
									<li><strong>Why do we meet multiple times a week? Do I have to show up every day?</strong> <p>Because we compete against other schools, we need to put a lot more than the usual two hours a week into making robots, and as competitions draw closer we may meet even more frequently! While you're encouraged to show up to all meetings, we understand things come up and it may not be possible to show up to every meeting, so making every meeting is not a requirement (though strongly encouraged if you would like to come to competitions, as we have limited spots!) </p> </li>
									<li><strong>What can I work on?</strong></li> <p>Whatever interests you the most! Whether that be coding, designing, or assembling the robot. Don't worry about needing experience, as long as you're willing to learn we will teach you the basics and help you grow your skills as you progress!</p>

										<h2>What we do</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Welcome to BMCC's Robotics Club! We are a diverse group of students passionate about robotics and engineering. Because robotics is a highly interdisciplinary field, we require the talent of not only engineers, but programmers, designers, and creative thinkers alike. Whether you're experienced or completely new to robotics, you'll have the opportunity to grow your skills and apply what you've learned in the classroom here. We work together to build innovative robots that compete in local and national competitions each year, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible and having fun along the way.
									</p>
									<p>
										At BMCC's Robotics Club, we turn ideas into reality by designing, building, and programming robots from start to finish. Our process combines classroom knowledge with hands-on learning, allowing members to apply their skills in real-world projects. Here's an overview of our workflow:

												<h3>Design</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												We start by brainstorming and designing our robots using 3D CAD software like Fusion 360. This stage is all about creativity and problem-solving, as we work to develop models that meet the needs of our competition challenges.

												<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Once the design is finalized, we bring our ideas to life by manufacturing the parts. This often involves 3D printing, laser cutting, or other fabrication methods to create precise components. Members learn how to handle various tools and techniques, making this stage a great introduction to hands-on engineering.

												Next, we wire up our robots, soldering components and connecting sensors, motors, and microcontrollers. This step is crucial as it brings together the hardware that powers our designs.

												<h3>Programming</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												While the physical robot takes shape, we code its functionality using Arduino C. Programming is where the magic happens; we write the software that controls the robot’s movements, sensor responses, and overall behavior.

												<h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Building robots is an iterative process. We continuously test our designs, refine the code, and make adjustments to improve performance. This back-and-forth approach is a great way to learn from mistakes, innovate, and perfect our robots before competition day.
